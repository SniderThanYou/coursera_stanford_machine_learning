This repository contains my homework submissions for the [Machine Learning course by Stanford University on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

If you are currently enrolled in this course, or may take this course at a future date, please do not refer to any code in this repository to aid you in solving the homework problems yourself. Doing so would violate both Stanford's and Coursera's honor codes.

This is easily the best online course I've ever taken. The instructor, Andrew Ng, was so good about explaining the high-level idea before zooming in on the details, then tying it all back to the bigger picture again. The videos were so good, that by the time I finished watching them, I didn't feel like I needed to do the homework to cement the ideas in my mind. I did the homework anyway, of course!

Here are some of the topics I learned in this course:

- Linear regression for regression problems
- Logistic regression for classification problems
- Feature regularization
- Neural networks
    - Hyperparameter opmitization
    - Architecture design
- Support Vector Machines
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Principal component analysis
- K-means clustering
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems
